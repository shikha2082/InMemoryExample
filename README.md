# InMemoryExample
Implementation of in-memory Repository

I have created the implementation of IRepository and added unit tests for each method that have been implemented under Repository class.
I have tested this repository with an entity "Department".

Future Enhancement: This eample can be enhanced by:
 - creating Database table - Department 
 - Create entity mapping
 - create DBContext to access data for this entity
 - Add a controller for Department Entity and set HttpGet, HttpPut etc method to fetch records from database using dbcontext
 - Finally any UI can be added to display, add or delete records
